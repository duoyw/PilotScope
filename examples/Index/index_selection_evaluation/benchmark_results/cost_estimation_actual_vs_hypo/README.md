# Comparison of cost estimations for hypothetical and actual indexes

In this experiment, we have compared the costs estimated by the PostgreSQL optimizer in the presence of actual and hypothetical indexes for the TPC-H and TPC-DS (both with a scale factor of 10) benchmark. We created single-attribute indexes for all attributes that are accessed in at least a single query. See the contained PDFs or excel files for results. Small discrepancies in cost estimations (below 1%) can be caused by sampling effects.
